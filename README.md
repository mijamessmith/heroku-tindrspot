1. Description

Spotind works with a users Spotify account to create a playlist containing songs searched in a completely random order. Spotify does not utilize compeltely random 
searches in their song suggestion. Instead, they take into account many data points gained from a user, the user's previous song history, and popularity charts
to suggest biased playlists or song suggestions, such as the Daily Mix playlists.

Spotind, on the other hand, looks through Spotify's billion song library and uses algorithms to find a completely random track to present to a user. From there, 
a user may like or dislike a track. Liked tracks are added to a Spotify Playlist available to the user on their Spotify account, titled "spotind". Regardless of a users
preference, Spotind will fetch a new song after a like or dislike choice is made.
